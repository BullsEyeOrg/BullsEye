# 🎯 BullsEye

*"Making bad decisions faster with AI"*

## What is BullsEye? 🤔

BullsEye is an open-source research chatbot that pretends to help you make better trading decisions. Because apparently, what the stock market really needed was another AI telling people when to buy high and sell low.

Built with the delusion that technology can solve human greed, this tool connects to Zerodha's Kite API and uses Groq's AI models to analyze your portfolio. Think of it as your digital *munimji* who never sleeps, never judges, and definitely won't steal from the cash drawer.
 
## Features That Actually Work 📈

- **Real-time Portfolio Analysis**: Watch your money disappear in high definition
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Get advice from machines that have never felt the pain of a margin call
- **Zerodha Kite Integration**: Because if you're going to lose money, do it through India's favorite broker
- **Modern UI**: Sleek interface to make your losses look aesthetic
- **Research Tools**: For when you want to feel scientific about your gambling addiction

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Next.js**: Because React wasn't complicated enough
- **Zerodha Kite API**: Your gateway to financial enlightenment (or bankruptcy)
- **Groq API**: AI that's faster than your portfolio's decline
- **TypeScript**: For when you want your code to be as type-safe as your investments aren't

## Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin this journey of self-discovery (and portfolio destruction), make sure you have:

- Node.js (preferably newer than your trading strategy)
- A Zerodha account (and the stomach for what's coming)
- Groq API key (free, unlike your trading education)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript (optional, just like risk management apparently)

## Installation 🚀

```bash
# Clone this repo (your first mistake)
git clone https://github.com/BullsEyeOrg/BullsEye.git

# Enter the danger zone
cd bullseye

# Install dependencies (and dependency on false hope)
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
```

## Environment Setup 🔧

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
KITE_API_KEY=your_kite_api_key
KITE_API_SECRET=your_kite_secret
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

*Pro tip: Guard these keys like they're the last samosa at a corporate meeting - because unlike your trading strategy, these actually work*

## Getting Started 🏁

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
# Prepare for enlightenment (or entertainment)
```

## How It Works 🧠

1. **Connect**: Link your Zerodha account (surrender your financial soul)
2. **Analyze**: AI processes your portfolio data (judges you silently)
3. **Chat**: Ask questions about your investments (receive existential crisis)
4. **Research**: Get insights based on market data (learn why you're wrong)
5. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle of hope and despair

## API Integration 🔌

BullsEye leverages:
- **Kite Connect API**: For real-time market data and portfolio information
- **Groq API**: For lightning-fast AI inference (faster than your money disappearing)
- **Next.js API Routes**: Because we needed more moving parts

- Your mileage may vary (and probably will, downward)

## Final Words 🎭

The market knows everything, the AI knows patterns, but nobody knows when to actually buy or sell. BullsEye just makes the confusion more organized.

Built with ❤️ and unrealistic expectations in India.
