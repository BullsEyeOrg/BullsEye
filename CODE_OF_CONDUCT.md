# 📜 Code of Conduct (Because Apparently We Need One)

This document outlines how **not to be a jerk** while you’re here. It’s less about rules and more about *vibes* — but for the sake of formality, let’s pretend this is structured.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The Golden Principle

**Don't be a tool.** Not the CLI kind — the human kind.

If you’re unsure whether your behavior is acceptable, ask yourself:  
_"Would I say this out loud to a stranger while stuck in a malfunctioning elevator during a heatwave?"_  
If the answer is no, **don’t**.

## 💬 Respect: The Minimum Viable Behavior

- Respect people's time, ideas, and pull requests (even if they contain `console.log("pls work")`).
- Not everyone codes in the same way. That’s okay. If they’re wrong, help them. Gently.
- Debate ideas, not people. This isn't Twitter.

---

## 🧘‍♀️ Diversity and Inclusion (aka Don't Be Weird About It)

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds, skill levels, keyboard sizes, and caffeine dependencies.

This means:
- No harassment, hate speech, gatekeeping, or “ironic” bigotry.  
- No condescending “Well actually…” unless it's followed by a Stack Overflow link *and* humility.  
- No trying to prove your genius at the expense of someone else's sanity.

## 🧹 Moderation (The Grown-Ups in the Room)

If you cross a line:
- We will talk to you.
- If talking doesn’t work, we will mute, block, or ban — not out of spite, but because we value peace more than drama.
- If you somehow create *a new kind of problem* never before seen in open source, you may be commemorated in an internal Slack message as a cautionary tale.

---

## 😶 Reporting Things (When the Vibes Are Off)

If someone is being a problem:
- Email [bullseysorg@gmail.com]  
- Or open an issue if it’s public, technical, or you want to make a statement like, “I will not be silenced.”

Reports will be handled discreetly, unless your report is basically just, “This person said semicolons are optional,” in which case — we’ll mediate, but also roll our eyes.

---

## 🤡 Final Thought

This is a weird little corner of the coding universe. Let’s keep it weird, but also kind.  
Contribute code, not chaos. Roast bugs, not people. And remember:

> Everyone’s going through something — except the CI pipeline, which is just cruel by design.

Thanks for being here. Or at least for reading this instead of writing passive-aggressive comments on Reddit.
