# So You Wanna Contribute, Huh? 🤹‍♂️

First of all, **welcome**, brave soul. If you're reading this, either:
- You've found a bug (congrats, the prophecy foretold this),
- You're bored at work and this repo seemed quirky,
- Or you just love pain — which makes you one of us.

## Before You Begin 🙏

Please ensure:
- You're using **your brain** and not just autopilot copypasta mode.
- You've **read the code** (or at least pretended to — we respect commitment to the bit).
- You're not about to rewrite everything in [insert trendy language here] because "it's cleaner, bro".

## How to Contribute ⚙️

1. **Fork** this chaos.
2. **Clone** your fork like a true hacker in a 90s movie.
3. Create a **new branch** (please don't call it `fix-stuff` or `patch-1`, have some flair).
4. Write code. Break stuff. Fix it. Repeat until enlightened.
5. Commit with a message that tells us _something_ (no "Update README" ten times, we beg you).
6. **PR like a Rockstar.** Open a Pull Request. Add a description that's more helpful than “fixed stuff”.

## 🧘 Code Guidelines (We Pretend to Have Standards)

- Follow the existing code style — we use ESLint and Prettier to keep the entropy symmetrical.
- Write meaningful commit messages. Not poetic, not cryptic, just... coherent.
- If you’re introducing bugs cleverly disguised as features, *at least* add a test. Predictable failure is still a kind of success, philosophically speaking.

## Bugs? Features? Or Existential Crises? 🐛

- Found a bug? Open an issue.
- Got a feature idea? Open an issue.
- Spiraling after realizing your entire app is just an API wrapper? Go outside, touch grass, _then_ open an issue.

## Tests? Maybe. Probably. Kinda. 🧪

If your contribution doesn’t break everything — amazing.
If it has tests — we will literally throw a virtual party in your honor.

## Feedback: The Gift That Keeps on Giving 💌

We may:
- Approve your PR.
- Roast your code (lovingly).
- Ghost you (not ideal, but hey, we’re developers).

## Final Words of Non-Wisdom 🧘‍♀️

This repo is a digital organism — sometimes alive, sometimes undead. By contributing, you agree to:
- Embrace the absurdity,
- Accept constructive chaos,
- And debug like the universe is watching (because it is).

**Thanks for contributing! Or at least reading this far — that’s contribution enough in spirit.**
